# Installation

## Requirements

- Node.js `>=22` (`>=22.12` to run NestJS 12 — see [Support Policy](./support-policy))
- NestJS `^11.0.0 || ^12.0.0`
- tRPC 11.x

For the supported API tiers and compatibility boundary, see [Support Policy](./support-policy).

## Install the Package

```bash
npm i @nest-native/trpc @trpc/server
```

## Peer Dependencies

These are required by any NestJS app and should already be installed:

```bash
npm i @nestjs/common @nestjs/core reflect-metadata rxjs
```

## Optional: Zod v4

If you want tRPC-style schema validation (`@Query({ input: z.object(...) })`) and auto schema generation:

```bash
npm i zod@^4
```

:::tip Zod is optional
If you prefer Nest-style validation (`class-validator` + `ValidationPipe`), you can use @nest-native/trpc without Zod. See [class-validator validation](./validation/class-validator) for details.
:::

## Zero Runtime Dependencies

`@nest-native/trpc` has an empty `"dependencies": {}` block by design:

- It never pulls a second NestJS runtime into your app
- Your app controls Nest and tRPC versions through peer dependencies
- All capabilities come from packages you already have: `reflect-metadata`, `@nestjs/common`, `@nestjs/core`, `@trpc/server`, and Node built-ins
