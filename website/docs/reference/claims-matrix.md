# Claims Matrix

This page maps the main public claims to current verification evidence. It is a release-readiness checklist, not marketing copy.

## Runtime and API Claims

| Claim | Current evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary setup uses `TrpcModule.forRoot()` and `forRootAsync()`. | `packages/trpc/test/module/trpc-module.spec.ts`, `website/docs/module-setup/for-root.md`, `website/docs/module-setup/for-root-async.md` | Covered by package tests and docs. |

## NestJS Integration Claims

| Claim | Current evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guards execute for tRPC procedures. | `packages/trpc/test/router/trpc-router-lifecycle.spec.ts`, `packages/trpc/test/context/trpc-enhancer-runtime.factory.spec.ts`, `sample/02-enhancers-guards-pipes-filters` | Covered by package tests and samples. |

| Interceptors execute for tRPC procedures. | `packages/trpc/test/router/trpc-router-lifecycle.spec.ts`, `website/docs/enhancers/interceptors.md`, `sample/02-enhancers-guards-pipes-filters` | Covered by package tests and samples. |
| Filters can remap procedure errors. | `packages/trpc/test/router/trpc-router-lifecycle.spec.ts`, `website/docs/enhancers/filters.md`, `sample/02-enhancers-guards-pipes-filters` | Covered by package tests and samples. |
| Request-scoped providers work with tRPC calls. | `packages/trpc/test/router/trpc-router.spec.ts`, `website/docs/advanced/request-scope.md`, `sample/03-context-request-scope`, `sample/00-showcase/scripts/smoke-express.ts` | Covered by package tests and smoke samples. |
| NestJS internals are isolated behind a compatibility boundary. | `website/docs/advanced/nest-internals.md`, `packages/trpc/context/trpc-enhancer-runtime.factory.ts` | Documented and isolated in code. |
| NestJS `^11.0.0 \|\| ^12.0.0` — both majors run the suite and every sample. | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (default legs on 11, `nestjs-latest-major` on 12), `scripts/check-nestjs-major.mjs` | Covered by CI on both ends of the peer range; the 12 leg proves what each workspace resolves before running. |
| Node.js `>=22`, with `>=22.12` to load NestJS 12 from CommonJS (`require(esm)`); both README compatibility tables, the support policy, installation, and the guidelines' support line carry the manifest's `engines` floor and `@nestjs/*` peer range. | `packages/trpc/package.json` (`engines`, `peerDependencies`), `scripts/check-compat-tables.mjs` (in `npm run release:check`) | Covered by a release check that fails when any of those pages lags the manifest. |
| No `@nestjs/*` deep import targets a directory index (NestJS 12 is ESM-only; its exports map resolves files only). | `packages/trpc/test/nestjs-deep-imports.spec.ts` | Covered by a package test that scans every source and test file. |

## Release and Packaging Claims

| Claim | Current evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Published package keeps zero runtime dependencies. | `packages/trpc/package.json`, `scripts/check-package-pack.mjs` | Covered by package metadata and release pack check. |
| Package and sample versions stay synchronized for releases. | `scripts/check-version-sync.mjs`, `RELEASING.md` | Covered by release check and release docs. |
| README links stay valid. | `scripts/check-readme-links.mjs`, `npm run release:check:readme-links` | Covered by release check. |
| Package tarball excludes unintended artifacts. | `scripts/check-package-pack.mjs`, `npm run release:check:pack` | Covered by release check. |
| Package source functions stay within the cognitive-complexity threshold. | `eslint.complexity-check.config.mjs`, `npm run complexity:check`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Covered by dedicated CI threshold check. |

## Known Verification Gaps

These gaps should guide future PRs:

- Add golden tests for generated schema formatting if output formatting becomes part of the release claim.
- Keep benchmark claims out of README and docs until a reproducible benchmark harness exists. See [Benchmark Methodology](../advanced/benchmark-methodology).

## Unsupported Claim Examples

Do not make these claims unless new code, docs, and tests are added:

- "Official NestJS integration."
- "WebSocket subscription transport is available." Subscriptions are SSE-only (`httpSubscriptionLink`); no `wsLink`/`applyWSSHandler` integration exists.
- "tRPC `observable()` subscriptions are supported." The subscription wrapper streams async iterables only; `observable()` return values do not stream.
- "Production security is handled by the library." Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, CORS, and secret handling are application responsibilities. See [Security Responsibilities](../advanced/security-responsibilities).
- "Benchmarked faster than REST, GraphQL, or vanilla tRPC."
- "All package internals are stable extension points."
